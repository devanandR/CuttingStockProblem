In a steel manufacturing industry, we have a stock of large-sized rods, each with a size of 15 feet. The customer requires three different types of rods, 1) 80 rods, each with the size of 4 feet, 2) 50 rods of size 6 feet, and 3) 100 rods, each with the size of 7 feet. Let us call them demand order types d1, d2, and d3. The objective is to meet the customer's demand by cutting off a minimum number of possible large-sized rods.
